I developed a full-stack web application using React, Python, and AWS Cloud services, which facilitates users in creating, discovering, and joining various events.
For user authentication, I implemented Google Identity Services within the React framework, enhancing security and user experience by streamlining the login processes.
Additionally, I utilized DynamoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, effectively handling high volumes of event data and user interactions with high availability and scalability.
